This Flutter app fetches and displays the weather forecast for London using the OpenWeatherMap API. It shows the current temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed, along with an icon representing the weather condition. The app also provides a horizontal scrollable view of the hourly weather forecast, displaying the temperature and weather icon for each hour. Users can refresh the weather data using a refresh button on the app bar.
